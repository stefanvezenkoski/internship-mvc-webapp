# Internship Companies Manager

**Project for Internet Technologies Course**

The **Internship Companies Manager** is a **.NET MVC Web Application** designed to facilitate the management and overview of companies offering student internships. Administrators can easily add, edit, and delete company information, while students (users) can quickly browse all available companies, their sectors, contact information, and number of open positions.

## Application Features
- Clear role division: **Admins** have full data management rights, while **Users** can only view information, enabling secure and controlled interaction.
- Built using the **.NET MVC design pattern** that facilitates maintenance and future expansion.
- Implementation of **modern UI technologies** for an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

## Practical Application
This solution is applicable at both faculty and company levels, enabling better organization and fast access to information about student internship opportunities. It is useful for students, administrators, and companies alike.
